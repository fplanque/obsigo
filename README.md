# obsigo v0.2 - Obsidian to hugo bridge

A converter/bridge from **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** to **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)** for Static Website Generation, 
including **foreverlinks** redirects for **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)**.

This is super-niche but if you are going to use Obsidian + Hugo + Netlify, this will save you so much time you'll want to hug me ;)  

## Why do we need this?

1. Because Obsidian is great for editing and managing a collection of Markdown files and Hugo is great for 
   generating a static website from Markdown files, BUT:
   - Hugo works best when all your files are named `index.md` (but in different folders of course) but this makes it 
     Ã¼ber-painful to search and manage your posts/articles in Obsidian. (Non-descriptive filenames... seriously Hugo?)
   - Both tools don't agree on the exact same flavor of Markdown (e-g: embedding YouTube videos)
   - They don't agree on the way links should be made from one file to another (the whole `index.md` thing again)
2. Hugo can do basic redirects BUT:
   - They are NOT proper 301 redirects (they are JS redirects, which are bad for SEO)
   - They are NOT foreverlinks (they only redirect from a single URL to another single URL, not from `*/old_slug` or `*/old_slug/` to `current_canoncial_URL`)
3. Hugo short tags have limitations (To be addressed in a future version of obsigo)

## Usage

Run `..path.to../obsigo.sh` from your hugo directory.

Obsigo will read a content source directory (typically `content_src` but could be any location you are managing 
with Obsidian) and write to a destination directory (typically `content`) that `hugo` will then process to 
generate a static site.

Obsigo will also generate foreverlinks, typically by writing redirects to `static/_redirects` (those redirects are
in the format expected by Netlify)

## Features

Obsigo will do the following actions:

### Nicer directory and filename structure

When using Obsigo, you don't have to use leaf nodes for everything and you don't have to name all your pages `index.md`.

You can also rename your files around in Obsidian without worrying, not only because Obsidian updates the links but also 
because Obsigo will detect the change and generate foreverlink redirects for you!

- Converting obsidian `/xyz/pagename.md` to hugo `/xyz/pagename/index.md`
- Converting obsidian `/xyz/leaf-node/leaf-node.md` to hugo `/xyz/leaf-node/index.md`
- Automatically handle renamed files. If `/cat/oldname.md` becomes `/cat/newname.md`, obsigo will detect it because the
  frontmatter `slug:` will still be `oldname`. At that point, obsigo will add `oldname` to the frontmatter `aliases:`
  and will change he frontmatter `slug:` to `newname`. (This will, as any alias, 
  generate a foreverlink from `*/oldname` to `/cat/newname`.
- Automatically rename source files that were named `index.md` to `slug.md` so that your source files are easier to
  identify in search results.


### Frontmatter/Metadata processing
 
- Cleanup/Remove unimportant keys from your FrontMatter YAML (IMPORTANT: these changes will be written back 
  to the source directory!)
- Collect slugs & aliases from frontmatter `aliases:`, `slug:`, the _filename_`.md` or the _folder_name_`/index.md`
  - Detect duplicates in the above!
  - Generate foreverlinks from the above and save them to a Netlify-compatible `_redirects` file
  - Also add additional customs redirects from `_redirects_base.txt` (if it exists)
- Automatically add missing `slug:` to frontmatter (base on filename or foldername)

### Content pre-processing

- Integrate captions from image links: `![alt](image.jpg "discarded title")` "caption" -> `![alt](image.jpg "caption")`.
  This is done so that captions are clearly seen when editing in Hugo.
  This is also designed to be used in conjunction with a Hugo theme that supports image captions.
  TODO: Try hugo's shortcode for figure https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure
- #hashtag linking: Convert all occurrences of `#some-hastag` to `[#hashtags](/tags/some-hashtag.md)`
- Rendering bugfix: Convert single occurrences of ` # ` to `\# ` to prevent Hugo from interpreting it as a header
- Internal links conversion:
  - `.../xyz/index.md` -> `.../xyz/`
  - `.../xyz/leaf-node/leaf-node.md` -> `.../xyz/leaf-node/`
- YouTube: Use Hugo shortcode:
  - `![TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0yhHKWUa0g)` -> `{{< youtube M0yhHKWUa0g >}}`
  - `![TED Talk](https://youtu.be/M0yhHKWUa0g)` -> `{{< youtube M0yhHKWUa0g >}}`

### Audit features

- List all Markdown links found (for auditing)
- List all HTML links found (for auditing)
  - Suggest Markdown equivalents (to be manually applied; useful for cleaning up legacy content)
